Safe Rust wrapper around the [pcan-basic-sys](https://github.com/tsabelmann/pcan-basic-sys) crate wrapping `V4.6.0.600` of the [PCAN-Basic API](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-Basic.239.0.html) provided by the [PEAK-System Technik GmbH](https://www.peak-system.com/).

**Disclaimer**: Since I am currently working on this crate, API changes may appear at any time. Please consider this if
you want to use this crate. However, most features should be stable so not much to worry about.
